# SI 506: Problem Set 05
This week's problem set includes five (5) problems that utilize your knowledge of tuples, 
conditional statements, for loop, list indexing, slicing, functions and dictionaries.
Problems 1 introduces how we can manipulate tuples. In Problems 2, 3 and 4, you will build 
utility functions to perform specific tasks. In Problem 5, you will combine your skills to 
craft a main() function that will reuse the functions defined in Problems 2, 3 and 4 in order 
to write code more elegantly and more efficiently.

Retrieve the problem set 05 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_05)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_05.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
