# Readings: Week 07

This week you will encounter a new data type, the tuple.  A Python tuple is an ordered sequence of items. Once created, the tuple is considered immutable. Like list elements, tuple items can be accessed via indexing and slicing, but unlike lists tuple values cannot be modified. This feature provides optimization opportunities when working with sequences of values that must not change or form "natural" associations ('Ann Arbor', 'MI', 'USA').

Working with tuples is the only new topic that will be introduced this week. We will spend most of this week and the early part of next week in review mode in preparation for next week's midterm exam.

In addition to the two tuples readings, I've also added another article on dictionaries, this one focused on a number of useful iteration techniques.

## Tuples

**Charles Severance, [Python for Everybody. Exploring data in Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book) (CreateSpace, 2016).**

:bulb: Entry point for the beginner.

Read Chapter 10 “Tuples”

Read Chuck on working with tuples. Then review Lisa's article.

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["Understanding Tuples in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-tuples-in-python-3) (Digital Ocean, Jan 2017).**

Lisa's take on tuples.

## Tuple Methods Reference

**w3schools, ["Python Tuple Methods"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp) (w3schools.com, nd).**

## Dictionaries: iteration

**Leodanis Pozo Ramis, ["How to Iterate Through a Dictionary in Python"](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/) (RealPython, May 2019).**

Discusses a variety of useful iteration techniques that reiterate, reinforce, and build on last week's discussion.
